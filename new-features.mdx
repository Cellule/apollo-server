## New APIs

### server.addPlugin API

You have to call it before `server.start()`. Useful if you want to pass the server itself to the plugin’s constructor.

### New HTTP request execution API
There’s a lot here :)
Also we’ve changed the TypeScript names of the constructor options object from Config to ApolloServerOptions.
